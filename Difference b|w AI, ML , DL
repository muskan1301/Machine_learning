AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), and DL (Deep Learning) are related concepts, but they have distinct differences:

1. AI (Artificial Intelligence): It refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, 
such as problem-solving, decision-making, and perception. AI is a broad field that includes several techniques, such as rule-based 
systems, expert systems, and machine learning.

2. ML (Machine Learning): It is a subset of AI that involves teaching machines to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed.
It enables machines to improve their performance on a task over time by learning from experience. ML algorithms can be supervised, 
unsupervised, or reinforcement learning.

3. DL (Deep Learning): It is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from large amounts of data.
Deep learning algorithms can automatically learn to recognize patterns in data, and can be used for tasks such as image recognition, 
speech recognition, and natural language processing.

Therefore, AI is the broader concept that encompasses ML, and DL is a subset of ML that involves deep neural networks.
