Supervised learning is a branch of machine learning where an algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions. It involves learning a 
mapping function that can predict the correct output given new, unseen input data. The process includes collecting labeled data, splitting it into training 
and test sets, selecting a suitable model, training the model using the training data, evaluating its performance on the test set, and deploying it to make 
predictions on new data. 
Supervised learning includes:
  Regression
  Classification
  1. Regression: Regression algorithms are used when the output variable is continuous or numerical. The goal is to predict a value based on input features. 
                 Examples include linear regression, polynomial regression, and support vector regression.
  2. Classification: Classification algorithms are used when the output variable is categorical or discrete. The goal is to assign inputs to predefined classes 
                     or categories. Examples include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and naive Bayes.
